### Hi there 👋

Visit my [personal webpage](https://jcwang.org/) for more details about my experience.

- 🎓 I am a UMass BTP Fellow and Douglas Fellow, currently a chemical engineering Ph.D. candidate at **UMass Amherst**.
- 💊 I am currently a Co-Op at **Boehringer Ingelheim**, focusing on the prediction of the sites of metabolism.
- 🔋 I am currently working on electrochemical systems for energy storage and conversion using computational methods.
- 🥽 I am interested in 3D visualization of chemical structures. You can view my work on my [Sketchfab webpage](https://sketchfab.com/gur0bi).
