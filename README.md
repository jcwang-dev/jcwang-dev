### Hi there 👋

Visit my [personal webpage](https://jcwang.org/) for more details about my experience.

- 🎓 I am a UMass BTP & ChemE Douglas Fellow, and a Ph.D. candidate in chemical engineering at **UMass Amherst**.
- 💊 I was a Material and Analytical Sciences Co-Op at **Boehringer Ingelheim**.
- 🥽 I am interested in 3D visualization of chemical structures. You can view my work on my [Sketchfab webpage](https://sketchfab.com/gur0bi).
